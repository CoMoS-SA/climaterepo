The Weighted Climate Data Repository (WCDR) provides a user-friendly dashboard to explore and download climate data weighted by measures of economic activity and aggregated at the national or subnational scale.
The dashboard allows users to:
* Choose to retrieve raw climate data about temperature, precipitation and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) from different sources and geographical/time resolutions;
* Weight raw climate data using alternative gridded measures of economic activity;
* Explore and download the resulting dataset in a single, accessible, and organized repository in a flexible way.

The project is run within the [Institute of Economics](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/istituto/economia) and [L'EMbeDS](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/department-excellence/embeds) at [Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies](https://www.santannapisa.it/en) (Pisa, Italy) by [Giorgio Fagiolo](https://sites.google.com/view/giorgiofagiolo/home), Marco Gortan, [Francesco Lamperti](http://www.francescolamperti.eu/) and [Lorenzo Testa](https://testalorenzo.github.io/).

## The Dashboard
Within the WCDR dashboard, the user can choose:
* *Climate variable*: available climate variables are temperature and precipitation (daily, monthly and annual observations) and SPEI (standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index; monthly observations);
* *Data source*: we currently support data from [Climatic Research Unit (CRU TS)](https://www.uea.ac.uk/groups-and-centres/climatic-research-unit), [Delaware Climate Office](https://climate.udel.edu/), [ECMWF's ERA5](https://www.ecmwf.int/) and [CSIC](https://spei.csic.es/index.html);
* *Geographical resolution*: data can be downloaded at both the [GADM](https://gadm.org/) geographical resolution of GADM0 (World countries) and GADM1 administrative areas (i.e. regions within World countries);
* *Weighting type*: we provide the possibility of weighting climate data by measures of economic activity linking grid data to administrative units. There are currently three options: (i) **no weights** (i.e., download raw climate data); or weighting climate data by gridded (ii) **population density** from [NASA's SEDAC](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11); (iii) **night lights usage** (from [Li et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0510-y));
* *Weighting year*: users can select the base year for the weighting variable according to which climate variables will be weighted;
* *Time resolution*: daily, monthly, and yearly observations can be employed;
* *Threshold*: If activated, this option allows to specify a threshold type (percentile or absolute value) and a threshold value for the historical time-series of a geographic unit; only days whose climate-variable observations are over the threshold value are retained.

Resulting data can be:
* Graphically explored as time series or using choropleth maps;
* Downloaded as *csv* or *json* files, in both **long** or **wide** data format.

Learn more about the WCDR by reading our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05971)!

Users willing to run our pipelines on their own data are very welcome to reach out to us!

Stay tuned for updates!
